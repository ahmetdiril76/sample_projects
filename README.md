# scraping_sahibinden_single_step
In this Jupyter Notebook, I created a scraper to scrape sahibinden.com which is a famous Turkish website 
where almost anything is sold, but especially cars and real-estate. This scraper only browses inside 
the main page does not follow the individual entry links where there are more information.
Hopefully I will write scraping_sahibinden_double_step where we will also follow these links and obtain
the extra information.
This one I might also write in bash script. Not sure yet!
